# first-website
My first website that I ever made.


I made this website over a year ago in my first web design class. Our assignment was to make a simple three page site with some information about ourselves. Since I had never made a website before, the design of the site is fairly simple, but I think it looks good for a first try. I like having this site to look back on and see how far I've progressed.

---- HOME PAGE ----
The home page is just a picture of myself and a short description. I also included a few links to educational websites that I use and enjoy.

---- GALLERY PAGE ----
On the gallery page, I included some pictures that show who I am and what I'm interested in. I tried to make it neat and somewhat responsive. While it's not perfect, I'm proud of my first attempt at web design.

---- FAVORITES PAGE ----
I made this page just to include some more information about myself and what I like. Even though this was made over a year ago, most of the information on here is still correct.
